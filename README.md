## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antonio (4ht0h10), I'm from Spain and I'm currently working for [UST](https://www.ust.com/en) as QA Engineer.

I'm a Software engineer with extensive experience in IT, mainly focused on:

- Data Scientist.
- Requisites Engineer.
- Automation of Functional and PerformanceTests.
- BDD, Continued Integration and Configuration Management.
- Analysis and Design of Databases.
